#  Smart Triage AI

**Smart Triage AI** is a full-stack web application developed for the HackTheAI hackathon. It serves as an intelligent assistant for customer support teams, using a multi-step AI workflow to automatically analyze, categorize, and prioritize incoming support tickets.

## ‚ú® Features

* **AI-Powered Ticket Analysis:** Utilizes a SmythOS AI agent to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine a ticket's **category** (e.g., Hardware, Billing) and **sentiment**.
* **Intelligent Prioritization:** A custom rules engine automatically assigns a **priority** (High, Medium, Low) based on the AI analysis.
* **User & Ticket Management:** A complete system for user registration and authenticated ticket submission, with all data stored persistently in a **SQLite database**.
* **Live Admin Dashboard:** A dynamic dashboard that displays all tickets in real-time, allows admins to update ticket statuses, and shows live statistics.
* **On-the-Fly Statistics:** An API endpoint that provides judges with real-time statistics on tickets created and solved within the last hour.

* VS Code with the **Live Server** extension is recommended for the frontend.

## Clone & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>

# Navigate into the project directory
cd <project-folder-name>

# Create and activate a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows, activate with: venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux, activate with: source venv/bin/activate

# Install all the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


## üöÄ Running the Application

### Start the Backend Server:

In your terminal (with the virtual environment activated), run the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload

### Run the Frontend:

1. In VS Code, right-click on the `.html` file.
2. Select **"Open with Live Server"**.
```

The backend API will now be running at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

# Future Work

- **Full User Authentication**: Implement a proper login system with passwords and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

- **Email Notifications**: Automatically send email alerts to support agents when a new "High" priority ticket is created.

- **Hospital Triage System**: Adapt the core engine for a healthcare use case to triage patient injuries based on images and descriptions, routing them to the correct specialist.
